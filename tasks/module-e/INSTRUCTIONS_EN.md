# Module E - Speed Tasks

In this module, it is necessary to implement several mini-tasks.

## Competitor Information

For some tasks, the media files contain videos demonstrating the final work.

## Tasks

### Task 1 - Website with scratch card

Create a website for distributing promo codes for bicycle use.

On the main page, implement a scratch card in the center, inside of which there is a random promo code with a description from a JSON file.

The promo code must remain the same even after refreshing the page. If the user has revealed the card with the promo code, then after reloading the page a new random promo code should be selected.

When the promo code is already known, the text should change to the corresponding description.

The website must be implemented for mobile devices.

### Task 2 - Custom Inputs

Implement several input fields for the website. All media files are provided with examples.

- Autocomplete input (HTML and CSS only).
- Input with animated placeholder (HTML and CSS only).
- Input for entering a complex password.
- Input with text-to-speech.

Some inputs do not have media files, which means they need to be implemented at your discretion.

Values for auto-suggestions: Specialized, Trek, Giant, Cannondale, Orbea.

- Background: `#060b23`
