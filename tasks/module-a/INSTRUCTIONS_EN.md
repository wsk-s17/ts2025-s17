# Module A - Static Website Design

For the promotion of cycling in the city, the company **VelOrda** has launched a project to create a safe and scalable online platform for managing bicycle rentals. Your development team has been tasked with building this service taking into account modern security and usability standards.

The goal of this module is to create a website for the client using only HTML and CSS.

Media files with some icons, images, and text are provided.

Since the website will be publicly accessible, it is important for the client that it meets accessibility standards (WCAG) and implements SEO best practices. Also, pay attention to Open Graph integration.

The website must be responsive for different screen sizes:
- Mobile: 360x640
- Tablet: 768x1024
- Desktop: 1920x1080

No server-side or client-side frameworks/libraries may be used. Only HTML and CSS are allowed, and the code must pass W3C validation.
