# Module F - Collaborative Challenge

After developing most of the components for the client, you are asked to form a group with other participants and create your own AI-powered Bicycle Diagnostic System, which can be integrated into the solution built in the previous modules.

You can show all your creativity — the diagnostic functionality can be implemented in any way, even simulated. The main requirement is that your system works and can be demonstrated in action (for example, as a prototype, web app, or simple scenario).

Then, your group must present the service to the other participants and experts.

The presentation should consist of three parts:

1. The Hook

The opening of the presentation that captures attention.

Example: "Imagine you’re getting ready for a weekend ride. You hop on your bike — but something feels off. The brakes squeak, the chain skips, and you’re not sure what’s wrong. What if an AI system could instantly tell you the problem and how to fix it?"

2. The Middle (main explanation + demonstration)

Here you explain what you created and why. Include a demonstration of your diagnostic system.

You can use the following structure:

Goal: What problem does your AI diagnostic system solve?
- Helps cyclists detect and prevent mechanical issues early, improving safety and convenience.

Approach: How did you develop the system?
- For example, using machine learning to analyze sounds, vibrations, or images from the bike to detect common issues like chain wear, brake problems, or flat tires.

Impact: What positive effect will this have?
- Reduces repair costs, extends the bike’s lifespan, and promotes safer and more sustainable cycling.

Path: Share your process — what challenges you faced, what worked well, and what insights you gained during development.

3. The Conclusion

Wrap up your presentation. Summarize why your AI diagnostic system is valuable, what unique advantages it provides, and why cyclists would want to use it.

Example: "With our AI-based bike diagnostics, every cyclist can become their own mechanic — safer rides, fewer surprises, and smarter maintenance."
